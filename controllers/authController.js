//JWT
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

// The JWT is made of 3 part, which is headers -> which tells the server what type of signature is being used (meta), payload -> which used to identify the user (e.g. contains user id), and signature -> which makes the token secure (like a stamp of authenticity)
// The way they all work togeher is like this: when our server is creating the JWT after a user successfully loggedin or registered, then it creates the header part and payload parts first and encodes them both. Then, to sign the token or to add the signature, it takes both of those two parts, and it hashes them together with something called a secret (a secure secret string) stored on the server. This secret must remain a secret, because it's the key to unlocking the JWT and the only way to verify a token. So when those three things are hashed together, it creates the token signature. Then, the token signature is added to the end of the JWT after the other two part and it can be send to the browser. -> Headers.Payload.Signature -> the JWT then is added into a cookie and sent and stored in a browser.
// So for any subsequent request to the server, the token is then received by the server inside that cookie. The server than can verify this token on every request by looking at the header and the payload and hashing them with the secret which remembered is stored on the server. If the hashed value of those two things with the secret matches the signature which remembered is also the hashed value of thos two part and the secret, it knows then that it's valid and the JWT has not been tampered with on the client. If the JWT had been tampered with on the client, for example the data in the payload is modified, then those two part either the header or the payload would have been changed right? And when they're hashed together with the secret, the would not match whatever the token signature is. Therefore that's how we say you're not logged in / you're not authenticated anymore.

    why do we need to specify the max age on the jwt signing and when we send the jwt as cookie?

    This sets the expiration time of the JWT itself. The JWT will become invalid after this period, meaning it cannot be used for authentication after it has expired. This is a critical security measure to limit the lifetime of a token and reduce the risk if it gets compromised.
    Cookie Expiration (maxAge option in res.cookie):

    This sets the expiration time of the cookie that stores the JWT. The cookie will be removed from the client (browser or mobile app) after this period, ensuring the client no longer sends an expired token to the server. Synchronizing this with the JWT expiration ensures that the token is not kept longer than its valid period.
